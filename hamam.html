        <p>Hamam is a brand of soap made in India and marketed by the Indian unit of Unilever.</p>
        <p> The brand was previously owned by Tata Sons.[1] The name comes from the Arabic/Persian word hammam, which refers to a public-bathing establishment in the Middle Eastern countries.</p>
        <p> It was once a leading bath soap brand in India.</p>
         <p> 100-gm bar costs 30 ₹.</p>
        <p>Hamam soap was established in 1931 as a mild soap that could be used by families.</p>
        <p>Hamam used natural ingredients in its products long before using all-natural ingredients was a trend. </p> 
        <p>It was, at one time, the only Indian-made natural soap. It is said to be pure and safe on the skin.</p>
         <p>Between 2009 and 2011, Hamam launched Hamam Nalangumavu soap. </p>
         <p>It has been withdrawn from the market due to regular Hamam's strong presence and lower sales numbers in the Nalangumavu variants.</p>
